Undertow features all new baddies, encounters, tyrants, and a double-sided battle mat. Battles take place both on land and on your raft, adding even more variety and brain-bending tactics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

			<comment username="ajlaw" rating="8.7" value="The more I play this one, the more I like it.  The dice + tactics during battles reminds me in some ways of what I like about KD:M showdowns.  The timer mechanism develops tension and the decision making during character customization keeps things interesting.  Replay value is high since characters are so different and character development is variable.  " />

			<comment username="jboyd33" rating="10" value="The original TMB is packed full of top notch components and fantastic characters. Chip Theory Games (CTG) truely produces the most amazing games and products and has a long standing reputation for wonderful on the spot customer service. I know I will continue backing CTG on future products for years to come. Glad to be part of the Undertow KS Campaign, including participating in the decision making for the mini story. Best part, is those decisions made in the daily spot light updates impact both the planned components for Undertow, as well as impacting &quot;mini-stretch goals&quot; that are not listed along with the listed stretch goals.

Great work CTG! Thanks for inviting us in for the ride and for this new twist on SG&#039;s and backer participation in the evolution of the components in the game!" />

			<comment username="Sandmanx82" rating="9" value="More of the same incredible game from the guys at Chip Theory. New life has been breathed into TMB for me, which was my game of 2017. I absolutely love the asymmetry, the components, the artwork, the gameplay, everything is a 10 for me other than the length, which can be troublesome. I don&#039;t mind a long game, I just need it to be a bit shorter to see the table more often. Everything else about this game is off-the-charts amazing." />
			<comment username="sbagnall" rating="N/A" value="Not going to rate but cannot wait for all this new content. Absolutely love this game. Goes down extremely well with both my gaming group and family. No one ever turns down a game of Too Many Bones." />
			<comment username="schevola" rating="10" value="TMB is an good play, with replayablity, I am not much on co-op games, but this one is hard to win, but fun to play.  You loose a lot, but want to play again because you just know you can win." />
